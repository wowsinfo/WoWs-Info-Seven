## 06/12/2019
### What have I done?
`Setup` has been added but it only has 3 titles now without any functionalities. Privacy policy & term of use were added (template only) but three languages are too much... 
I have to work harder maybe with my senpai! If I can deal with data correctly, the rest is just copy and paste my old code which shouldn't be really hard.
### What to do tomorrow?
More models, API and DataStorage.

## 04/12/2019
### What have I done?
`BasicDownloader` and `APIResponse`. There will be lots of classes but this is the only to make sure it is safe. Therefore, I have to write lots of code for this... but it is good in the long run.
### What to do tomorrow?
Add more models.

## 02/12/2019
### What have I done?
Updated to `1.0.7/1.6.6` to fix some bugs and tabs were added to log files.
### What to do tomorrow?
Same as below, `DataStorage`.

## 29/11/2019
### What have I done?
Mac OS on Surface with the help of [this repo](https://github.com/hacker1024/Hackintosh-Clover-SurfacePro3). It works really well and I am quite happy with it. `BottomButton` was created but it is kinda limited now. Some components were moved to `common/` folder. `Welcome` is done I think and for `Agreement`, I have added two button at the bottom. If the user declines, he/she will either go back to home or simply dismiss the alert.
### What to do tomorrow?
My exams is next Monday so I think I will do some serious study. The issue now is that I am still not clear on what I need to do for `DataStorage`. However, don't need to rush. I will reuse many codes from the old project (not really) so it should be fine.
