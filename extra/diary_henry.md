## 21/12/2019
### What have I done?
`Cacheable` now has two children, `Preference` and `CachedWiki`. 
### What to do tomorrow?

## 20/12/2019
### What have I done?
Some more designs on OneNote
### What to do tomorrow?
Actually write some codes and see if it works.

## 19/12/2019
### What have I done?
Updated folder structure and lots of refactoring have been done. 
Many new issues have been discovered and I am starting to write more downloaders and models. 
That's a lot of work to do but it is good this way. Do it slowly and don't rush. 
### What to do tomorrow?
Write some `APIDownloader` and maybe more updates on folder structure.

## 15/12/2019
### What have I done?
Meeting with senpai and some decisions were made. `Home` is now updated and `Loading` is added.
### What to do tomorrow?
More loading and maybe test update theme.

## 14/12/2019
### What have I done?
`Settings` has been updated to show a section list but is it really a good idea? 
`AppLogo` now takes a `size` and version number is added as well. 
### What to do tomorrow?
First meeting with senpai and some dicussions on some topics.

## 06/12/2019
### What have I done?
`Setup` has been added but it only has 3 titles now without any functionalities. Privacy policy & term of use were added (template only) but three languages are too much... 
I have to work harder maybe with my senpai! If I can deal with data correctly, the rest is just copy and paste my old code which shouldn't be really hard.
### What to do tomorrow?
More models, API and DataManager.

## 04/12/2019
### What have I done?
`BasicDownloader` and `APIResponse`. There will be lots of classes but this is the only to make sure it is safe. Therefore, I have to write lots of code for this... but it is good in the long run.
### What to do tomorrow?
Add more models.

## 02/12/2019
### What have I done?
Updated to `1.0.7/1.6.6` to fix some bugs and tabs were added to log files.
### What to do tomorrow?
Same as below, `DataManager`.

## 29/11/2019
### What have I done?
Mac OS on Surface with the help of [this repo](https://github.com/hacker1024/Hackintosh-Clover-SurfacePro3). It works really well and I am quite happy with it. `BottomButton` was created but it is kinda limited now. Some components were moved to `common/` folder. `Welcome` is done I think and for `Agreement`, I have added two button at the bottom. If the user declines, he/she will either go back to home or simply dismiss the alert.
### What to do tomorrow?
My exams is next Monday so I think I will do some serious study. The issue now is that I am still not clear on what I need to do for `DataManager`. However, don't need to rush. I will reuse many codes from the old project (not really) so it should be fine.
